# General info

I’ve chosen JS + Protractor because it uses Selenium Webdriver API, it is easier and faster to setup and I can concentrate on tests rather than on solving problems with environment. Moreover the install documentation will be shorter


# Please read the description below in order to set-up invironment:

1. Download and install Git from official site (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Download and install node-js from official site (https://nodejs.org/en/)
3. Download two js files from this repository - conf.js and todo-spec.js
4. Go to Protractor website (https://www.protractortest.org/#/) and follow the instructions in "Setup" section: perform the following commands in terminal
npm install -g protractor

webdriver-manager update

webdriver-manager start

5. Open the new window of terminal
6. Run the test using command
protractor conf.js

Voila! Test should run and pass.
